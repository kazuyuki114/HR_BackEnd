## üåê API Access

### Development Server
```bash
# Start server
python manage.py runserver

# Access points
API Root: http://localhost:8000/api/
Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/
API Browser: Available for all endpoints
```

### Response Formats
All endpoints return JSON with consistent structure:
- **Success**: HTTP 200 with data
- **Not Found**: HTTP 404 with error message  
- **Server Error**: HTTP 500 with error details

### CORS and Headers
Currently configured for development use. For production:
- Configure CORS settings
- Add authentication/authorization
- Set up proper security headers

## üìù Sample Workflows

### 1. Employee Onboarding Report
```bash
# Get department overview
curl http://localhost:8000/api/departments/1/

# Find available positions
curl http://localhost:8000/api/departments/1/positions/

# Check team members
curl http://localhost:8000/api/departments/1/employees/
```

### 2. Performance Analysis
```bash
# Get employee details with performance analytics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/employees/15/

# Department-wide analytics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/departments/analytics_all/
```

### 3. HR Dashboard Data
```bash
# Company overview
curl http://localhost:8000/api/employees/analytics_summary/

# Department statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/departments/stats/

# Individual department deep-dive
curl http://localhost:8000/api/departments/1/
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current State (Development)
- No authentication required
- Full read access to all data
- SQLite database for development

### Production Recommendations
- Implement JWT or session-based authentication
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Add rate limiting
- Configure HTTPS
- Implement audit logging
